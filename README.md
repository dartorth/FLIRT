Electronic Internal Referral Tool

## Rationale
--------------


1) Frequent complaint that ortho SHOs difficult to get hold of.
2) Collect information that eases documentation and avoids duplication.
3) Referral viewable by all on call team.
4) Offers direct links to departmental protocols
5) VFC/FC referrals may get missed.

Issues that will be additionally solved
1) Referral pathway now defined and documented
2) Required referral parameters identified so fewer incomplete referrals
4) May offer help/advice/ before referral is actually made
5) Can identify [training] needs
6) Can identify operational [changes] that may improve workflow, patient safety, 

The referral form will be simple, enhanced with assistance, allows attachment of pictures

Will generate documents that can be incorporated into the patient care record
